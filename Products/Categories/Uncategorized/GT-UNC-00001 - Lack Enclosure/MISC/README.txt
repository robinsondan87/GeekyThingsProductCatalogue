# Summary

<u><b>Version 2.0 - Has sliding rails to easily adjust for different spool widths</b></u>
My quest continues to keep improving my filament spool holders. Since I frequently change spools and almost every spool I have has a different width, I decided having something that could easily slide and adjust as opposed to discrete positions would be faster and easier. An added benefit of this remix is that the spool holders stay down and can't pop off. I've included any old files needed from my first version, https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2521463. 

(FIX: Thanks to signaturefish, He pointed out that there was an alignment problems with side holes on the TUSH2-Outside piece. I also tweaked the rail cut that was off on one side by a small amount on the TUSH2-Inside piece--noticed by eowindel.  I've removed the old ones and replaced them with fixed versions 1.1. )

<u><b>This version has the following benefits. </b></u>
<ul>
<li>Sliding rail for adjusting to any width spool</li>
<li>TUSH won't pop off rails</li>
<li>TUSH inside and outside pieces can accomodate a nut and bolot to hold it together 
<br>(M3 nut and M3x12 bolt) - This is optional. They will force fit and hold on bearing.</li>
<li>Outside piece has a raised guide to keep the spool from coming off the side.</li>
<li>Still can accommodate spool holder arms to keep the spool from being pulled off the TUSH when the spools get lite or tangled. I usually to be safe use at least one with any spool I'm using.</li>
</ul>

Notes: 
If you're having difficulty getting the TUSH to slide on the rails, take a deburring tool and run it over the rails edges to know off a little.
