# Summary

This is a 6" Filament Guide for Ikea Lack Table Enclosures. I've seen plenty around, but I needed to make a custom one with larger side on top to cover up chips in the top of the table while putting the holes in. 

I made sure to round both the edge coming into the top of the guide and also the bottom where the filament will be coming through. This was to help it slide more easily and not get caught on 90 degree edges.

**Dimensions: (Part that slides into table)**
L : 6" 
W : 3/8" 
H : Varies on STL used

L : 152.4mm
W : 9.1mm
H : Varies on STL

**How To:**
- Draw a line 5 5/8" in length where you want the slit for Filament to be.
- Drill a 3/8" hole on either side of the line (You will get 6" total length due to drill radius)
- Now drill out the entire line.
- Use whatever tool you find easiest to combine all the holes in to one slot 6" x 3/8"
- Sand Edges smooth
- Insert Filament Guide.

**Files:**
FilamentGuideSHORT - Allows you to put one on either side of the top piece to cover drill marks
FilamentGuideLONG - Allows you to use one piece to guide all the way through.
