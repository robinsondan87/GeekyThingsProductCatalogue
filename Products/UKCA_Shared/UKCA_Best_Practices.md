# UKCA Best Practices (Small Maker)

This is a lightweight checklist to keep UKCA compliance simple and consistent. It is not legal advice.

## Core records to keep
- Declaration of Conformity (DoC) per product.
- Risk assessment per product.
- Technical file: CAD, BOM, material specs, and any test evidence.
- Manufacturing notes and QC checks.
- Photos of labels/packaging.

## Standards and evidence
- EN71-1 (mechanical/physical): Use a checklist and inspection notes.
- EN71-2 (flammability): Covered by SunLU filament documentation.
- EN71-3 (toxicity): Covered by SunLU filament documentation.
- Keep supplier certificates and statements in `Products/UKCA_Shared`.

## Labeling and instructions
- UKCA mark on product/packaging.
- Product name + SKU for traceability.
- Manufacturer name and UK contact address.
- Age warning: not for under 3s.
- Include any assembly or safety instructions if required.

## Change control
- If design or materials change, update the risk assessment and DoC.
- Track version/date in the UKCA README.

## Retention
- Keep records for at least 10 years after the last product is sold.

## Quick sanity checks
- No sharp edges or small loose parts.
- No cords/loops that could cause strangulation.
- Surface finish is smooth and clean.
