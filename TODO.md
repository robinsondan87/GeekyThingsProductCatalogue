# TODO

- Review and decide how to handle files over 100 MB (large STL/3MF assets, logs, zips).
- Completed: Archive now moves items into a `_Archive` folder (Delete removed).
- Completed: Added Archived/Draft/B2B/Live tabs with archived/draft list views.
- Completed: Added a B2B category option for product creation.
- Review current UKCA folders and design an "Add UKCA" flow on product pages.
- Create a UKCA template and prompts to complete certification, referencing top-level UKCA folder.
- Include notes that flammability/toxicity (EN71-2/3) are covered by SunLU filament docs.
- Research UKCA best practices for small makers to simplify compliance (note: products not for under-3s; stickers already on hand).
