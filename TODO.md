# TODO

- Add Events feature: event records (name/date/location/fee/notes) and event selector for sales/stock adjustments.
- Add Sales ledger: per-line item records (SKU, qty, unit price, channel, payment method, fees) with event or online order linkage.
- Add Quick Sale mode for craft fairs (search/scan SKU, select variations, adjust stock, record payment).
- Add CSV import wizard for marketplace orders (Etsy CSV, eBay Seller Hub reports, TikTok Shop export orders), with SKU mapping and order dedupe.
- Add import history/audit log with raw CSV archived for rollback.
- Add low-stock alerts and print queue (target qty per event, reserve stock, show deficits).
- Add simple reporting: sales by channel/event, top SKUs, payout/fee totals.
